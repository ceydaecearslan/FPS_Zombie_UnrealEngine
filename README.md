# FPS Zombie Game
This project is like a consolidated version of my other Unreal Engine projects in my profile. It is a first-person shooter game featuring zombies as enemies. The goal is to survive by killing incoming zombies and successfully pass the final wave to win.
## Used Technologies

 - Unreal Engine 5.3.2
 - Unreal Engine Blueprint System



## Additional Information

- In this project, free ready-made assets have been utilized. 
- Player and zombie characters have been created using these assets, and their animations have been adjusted.
- The player blueprint has been prepared by making modifications on top of first person blueprint.
- The artificial intelligence of the zombies have been created using blueprints.
- The zombies take damage at two different levels: headshot and bodyshot.
- An UI containing a health bar, a crosshair and the information about waves/zombies has been created using widget blueprints.
